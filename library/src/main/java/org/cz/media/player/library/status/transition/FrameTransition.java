 * The frame transition
 * When the view change its frame from one to another. If you want to changing with an animation.
 * This is for you.
 *
 * We use {@link android.view.ViewPropertyAnimator} to simplify the animation.
 * You use childView.animate() to deploy your animation I could call this function to change the animation at the same time.
 * Because it is the same object.
 * <pre>
 *     public ViewPropertyAnimator animate() {
 *         if (mAnimator == null) {
 *             mAnimator = new ViewPropertyAnimator(this);
 *         }
 *         return mAnimator;
 *     }
 * </pre>
